This file contains the results of comparison of the four different implementations Factorial function:
Factorial_loop, Factorial_reduce, Factorial_func, Factorial_mem


Test environment specification: x86_64, Win10, Core I5, 32 Gb Ram, R version 3.3.1 (2016-06-21)
All tests include calling the function 100000 times
For comparing I use mean time in microseconds


First scenario
Light input: 5!

Factorial_loop   :  10.04479
Factorial_reduce :  23.99598
Factorial_func   :  41.53462
Factorial_mem    :  8.852114


Second scenario
Heavy input: 20!

Factorial_loop   :  14.83983
Factorial_reduce :  43.9741
Factorial_func   :  162.6003
Factorial_mem    :  9.214431


Summary:
Absolute winner is Factorial_mem. Because it uses previously calculated values.
Absolute loser is Factorial_func. Because it uses a lot of functions calls.
